1. Select over time slots of ~200s - 500s
2. Select position range within time slot with length 1000dm
3. calculate avg for this length slot
-> now we have for every position interval a bunch of values for RSSI and #TGs for different passes
4. calculate variance of RSSI for a given position
-> flag RSSI if above some threshold
-> set threshold using disruptions values (HOW?)
-> do the same for #TGs -> have to reformat from cumulative to per time interval first
